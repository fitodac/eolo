Hello and thank you for being here.
This is a tailwind ui kit but is still under development, please don't use it in production.
Please feel free to collaborate with this project.

Best regards.

# Eolo

### How to use

After install the `npm package` you need to import the plugin into the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
import eolo from 'eolo'

module.exports = {
	plugins: [eolo],
}
```

Then you need to import the stylesheet into your main css file, before any Tailwind directive:

```css
@import 'eolo';
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

To you know how to use the components plase visit: https://eolo.vercel.app

You'll help me a lot if you want to collaborate with this project in any way.
